# Data Science Projects

This repository contains all the code that I have used for personal data science projects 

The Yelp API returns cuisine types when entering a restaurant name and location (zip code or address or city/state)

The Google Maps API has a similar purpose, but it is more for finding out location hours, the type of business, and offerings
